**regexpr-cpython**    
_README, last updated on :- 26th of December, 2017_

regexpr for CPython(a CPython module for Python 2.7.x). An effort to edit text using regular expressions.  
---

At one point in my life, I had to work lot with regular expressions, I applied/used these regular expressions on streams of texts using grep and sed(may be few other tools, I do not remember). The nature of the project was such that I did not work on it regularly, worked on it just for couple of days and then not work on it at all for two or more weeks. Each time when I came back to the project, I sort of had to relearn lot of stuff about the tools that I was using and about forming regular expressions, etc. I got boared and frustrated and, then I thought about writing a one simple tool to do what I did on that project, hence this project is the outcome of that thought process. 

Example Application.
-----------------------
An \"example application\"(**regedit.py**) is part of the committed source code, use it as a usage guide and to test the smarts of regexpr-cpython module.

Dependency.
--------------
The script __regedit.py__ uses argsv-cpython module to process command line arguments. The module is at the following URL... __https://github.com/sohail/argsv-cpython.git__
